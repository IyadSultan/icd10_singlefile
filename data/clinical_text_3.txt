– Labs: WBC 15.2 K with left shift; lactate 1.9 mmol/L; CRP 105 mg/L; procalcitonin 1.2 ng/mL. Na 130, K 4.9, HCO₃ 22. BUN 44, Cr 2.2 (baseline 1.8). Glucose 268 mg/dL. BNP 650 pg/mL (prior 420). hs-Troponin negative ×2. A1c 9.2%. TSH 6.2 μIU/mL, free T4 low-normal.
– ABG on 2 L NC: pH 7.44 / PaCO₂ 35 / PaO₂ 62.
– Rapid flu/COVID negative. Blood and sputum cultures pending.
– Diabetic foot X-ray: No gas; no bony erosions.

Assessment/Plan:

1. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia with concurrent COPD exacerbation; possible mild volume overload from HFrEF.
   – Oxygen to maintain SpO₂ 88–92%.
   – Nebulized ipratropium/albuterol q4–6h; continue inhaled ICS/LABA/LAMA.
   – Prednisone 40 mg PO daily × 5 days.
   – Empiric ceftriaxone + azithromycin (monitor QTc; safe with non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy); de-escalate per cultures and clinical response; adjust dosing for CKD.
   – Incentive spirometry, pulmonary hygiene.
   – Daily weights, strict I\&O; consider gentle IV diuresis if persistent crackles/edema.

2. HFrEF (EF 35%)—possible mild decompensation.
   – Assess volume status daily; if overloaded, IV furosemide to net –0.5 to –1 L/day, monitor BMP and Mg.
   – Continue carvedilol if hemodynamically tolerated.
   – Temporarily hold spironolactone if K >5.0 or worsening renal function.
   – Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram if no study in 12 months or clinical change.

3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   – Rate control with IV/PO beta-blocker as BP allows; telemetry monitoring.
   – Continue apixaban 5 mg BID unless held for procedures; CHADS₂-VASc high.
   – Coordinate periprocedural anticoagulation hold for dermatologic excision (see #7).

4. AKI on CKD 3b (Cr 2.2 from baseline 1.8), likely pre-renal/inflammatory.
   – Hold metformin and lisinopril during AKI and hypotension; avoid nephrotoxins and IV contrast.
   – Renal-adjust all meds; daily BMP; urine lytes if persistent AKI.

5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled (A1c 9.2%).
   – Hold metformin due to AKI and infection.
   – Basal–bolus insulin with correction scale; bedside glucose before meals/HS; hypoglycemia protocol.
   – Diabetes education; consider CGM outpatient.

6. Hyponatremia (Na 130), likely multifactorial (HF vs SIADH from pneumonia).
   – Fluid status optimization; serum/urine osms and urine sodium; correct slowly (<8–10 mmol/L/24 h).

7. Suspicious left forearm lesion—concern for malignant melanoma.
   – Dermatology consult; excisional biopsy with 1–3 mm margin pending size/depth; sentinel node mapping if Breslow >0.8 mm or ulceration.
   – For biopsy: hold apixaban \~48–72 h prior given CKD; resume 24 h post-procedure if hemostasis secure; use SCDs while off anticoagulation.

8. Diabetic foot ulcer, Wagner grade 1–2, plantar right forefoot.
   – Wound care consult; offloading footwear; daily saline dressings; consider doxycycline or cephalexin if cellulitis evolves; optimize glycemic control; ensure tetanus up to date.

9. Hypothyroidism, suboptimally controlled.
   – Continue levothyroxine; recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks after acute illness resolves; assess adherence and interactions (PPI timing).

10. CAD with prior stent; hyperlipidemia.
    – Continue high-intensity statin.
    – No aspirin while on apixaban unless cardiology indicates.

11. Depression.
    – Continue sertraline; screen for sleep disturbance; reinforce CPAP adherence.

12. Obstructive sleep apnea.
    – CPAP nightly during hospitalization and after discharge; RT to refit mask.

13. Tobacco use disorder.
    – Brief cessation counseling; offer nicotine replacement and outpatient pulmonary rehab referral.

14. Preventive care and vaccines.
    – Offer influenza and COVID booster prior to discharge; review pneumococcal status (PCV20 if not previously received).

15. Disposition/Follow-up.
    – Admit to medicine service with telemetry.
    – Daily reassessment of oxygen requirement, renal function, and cultures for de-escalation.
    – Outpatient follow-up: pulmonology (COPD optimization, pulmonary rehab), cardiology (HF/AF management), dermatology/oncology (biopsy pathology and staging if melanoma), podiatry/wound clinic, endocrinology or diabetes educator.
    – Code status discussed: Full code (to be revisited with patient and family).
